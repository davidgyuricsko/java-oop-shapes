# Java OOP Shapes Project

This project demonstrates core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles in Java,
including inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, and encapsulation.

## 🧱 Design Overview
- An abstract `Shape` class defines common behaviour
- Concrete shape classes extend `Shape`
- Each shape calculates its own area and perimeter
- Polymorphism allows shapes to be handled through a common interface

## 🧠 What I Practised
- Designing class hierarchies
- Using abstract methods
- Method overriding
- Writing clean, readable Java code

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Java

## ▶️ How to Run
Compile and run the main class from the command line or an IDE.
